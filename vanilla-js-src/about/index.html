            <p>
              This site provides an introduction to the creative possibilities, tools and techniques for real-time
              remote and hybrid live arts experiences. It is intended as a companion to the virtual venue template
              (https://github.com/AidanNelson/virtual-venue), a free and open source codebase for artists and
              organizations interested in building their own infrastructure.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you're interested in developing creative work with real-time interactivity, read on.
              <br />
              <br />
              This site shares some learnings and explorations from several experiments in remote and hybrid
              performances. It is a collective effort between NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program and
              CultureHub. Are you working in remote or hybrid performance and want to get in touch? Please reach out at

          <!-- Interactivity -->
          <div class="py-5">
            <h4>Forms of Interactivity</h4>
            <p>Physical performance venues tend to facilitate a few core interactions between the performers and audience members (and ushers, house managers, etc.) inhabiting those spaces. These interactions might be roughly categorized into the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Performer to Performer - two dancers interact on stage</li>
              <li>Performers to Audience - an audience member watches dancers on stage</li>
              <li>Audience to Performer - an audience member claps after a performance</li>
              <li>Audience to Audience - audience members discuss the show, cut each other in line buying snacks, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In a typical performance livestream setup (i.e. the Metropolitan Opera Livestream), only the first two forms of interactivity is supported. Performers interact with one another (usually by interacting within the same physical venue) and broadcast to an audience.  In this configuration, audience members are given little-to-no agency** to interact with the performers or with one another. This might well fit the needs of many live performance venues, and many platforms support these features.


            </p>
            <p><i>** on platforms like YouTube Live, Twitch, and Vimeo, text comments or emoji reactions are often supported.</i></p>              
            <p>The appeal and interest of live performances extends beyond the mere fact that audience members are co-located with performers.  Live performance means experiencing a new space, people-watching, overhearing snippets of conversation, talking to strangers, admiring (or critiquing) the venue, and myriad other micro-interactions which contribute to the experience of a live performance.
            </p>
            <h5 class="p-3">How might we develop virtual venues which support the organic, messy and unplanned interactions which spontaneously happen when you put people together in a space? </h5>
